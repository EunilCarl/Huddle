It's january 8, 2023 5:44pm I've learned Python, Java, Html, Css and currently learning C++ this is the most time i've spent on creating a website it took me 14hrs lol,
it should've been 10hrs only but i thought my code is wrong so i fixed it while there's actually nothings wrong about it, so i wasted another 4hours fixing for nothing.

Welp we are having a defense and a entrep coming soon wish me luck

I got like 4-5months time to study programming languages
i still have a though if choosing compsci would be a regret or a good decision
wish all these thoughts would be gone and see myself in a decade or so reading this comment i made 
:)
